00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:01.626
Here's what to expect

00:00:01.626 --> 00:00:03.336
from your first Rinse.

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:04.129
To get started,

00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:06.089
create your account at rinse.com

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.132
or on the mobile app.

00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:07.841
Then tell us

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:09.134
what day you want your Valet

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:10.927
to pick up your first load of laundry.

00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:12.512
We can even pick up the same day

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:13.138
you sign up.

00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:13.847
Remember,

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.433
you wear the pants in this relationship.

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:17.392
We just wash them.

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:18.768
On the day of your first Rinse,

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:19.728
you'll get a text message

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:20.478
from your Valet,

00:00:20.478 --> 00:00:21.563
letting you know what time

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:22.355
they'll arrive.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:23.606
Make sure your clothes are ready

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:25.525
to go in a hamper or pile

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:26.860
because your Valet will bring

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.361
your brand new Wash and Fold

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.405
Rinse bag for you to put your clothes in.

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:32.532
It's like the Rinse Carlton.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:33.700
Rinse will take it from here

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.745
so you can go do whatever cool people do

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:37.746
with their free time.

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:39.122
While you're busy doing you

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:41.082
Rinse will carefully inspect,

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:43.126
wash, fold, and deliver

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:43.752
your laundry

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:45.754
in as little as 24 hours,

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:46.588
all while keeping

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:48.173
you updated along the way.

00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:49.507
The only thing you have to do

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:50.508
is put away

00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:51.217
your clean,

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:52.594
fantastic smelling,

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:54.846
neatly folded laundry.

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:56.139
If you'd like to try our dry

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:57.849
cleaning or hang dry services,

00:00:57.849 --> 00:01:00.310
just let us know via text or the app.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.644
Your dry cleaning will come back

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:02.771
cleaned, pressed,

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:04.272
and returned on a hanger

00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:05.523
and your hang dry clothes,

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:06.733
which is a perfect option

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.109
for delicates, will be returned

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:09.360
neatly folded.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.279
If you can't be home to meet your Valet,

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:13.031
you can always opt for person-less

00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:14.282
pickup, or delivery,

00:01:14.282 --> 00:01:16.076
or easily reschedule.

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.243
The next time you schedule

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:17.994
your Rinse pick up

00:01:17.994 --> 00:01:20.080
you’ll only have to press one button

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.164
and then you can whip out

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:22.874
your cool new Rinse bags.

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:24.084
Start with Rinse today

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:27.670
to take a load off your mind.
